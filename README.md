# Modelling-Bungee-Jumping
The action of a bungee cord is similar to that of a spring. Thus, in modeling bungee jumping we employ a critical law of physics concerning springs, Hooke’s law.
Hooke’s Law Within the elastic limit of a spring, where F is the applied force, k is the spring constant, and s is the displacement (distance) from the spring’s equilibrium position, the following formula holds: F = –ks
